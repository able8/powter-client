# powter-client

* With powter-client, you can build a powerful router without knowing details of how the router works
* The arm and x86 are both supported

### Who should use

* If the number of clients in a private network is between  11-500, x86 version is recommended
 

### Pros and cons

##### Pros

* Flexible strategy supported, ss+kcp or just ss
* Any number (usually 4-16) of ss+kcp is supported to satisfy different network flow requirement
* Anti DNS pollution
* Long term plan of development and maintenance(check roadmap)

##### Cons
